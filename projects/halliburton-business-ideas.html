            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project focused on designing a technology-driven safety
              solution for Halliburton to enhance workplace safety and
              operational efficiency. Our team proposed the Safety Inspection
              Manager (SIM) and Safety Control Center (SCC), which integrate
              wearable technology, AI-driven inspections, and real-time
              monitoring to reduce administrative workload, prevent safety
              incidents, and optimize compliance processes. This innovative
              solution aligns with Halliburton's "Journey to Zero" initiative,
              promoting a safer and more efficient work environment while
              reducing costs and risks.

          <!-- Problem & Solution -->
          <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
              Halliburton faced challenges with workplace safety, leading to
              increased costs and frequent accidents. These incidents not only
              disrupted operations but also affected employee morale and
              efficiency. The company sought a scalable, data-driven safety
              solution to minimize risks, improve compliance with safety
              regulations, and ensure a secure environment for its workforce.
            </p>

            <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
            <p>
              Our team proposed an innovative safety system leveraging real-time
              data monitoring and predictive analytics to identify potential
              hazards before they became incidents. By integrating IoT sensors
              into high-risk areas and deploying a user-friendly safety
              dashboard, we enabled proactive decision-making. The solution
              emphasized cost efficiency, reduced response times, and improved
              safety protocols, resulting in a 95% approval rating from the
              project evaluation panel.
